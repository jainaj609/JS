        Prepbuddy likes to wear different colored clothes. So, whenever he see there are two or more shirts with the
        same color, he removes all the shirt of that color from his wardrobe. Now, he wants to know how many
        M
        unique color shirts are left in the wardrobe. <br>
        Prepbuddy wants you to find
        M
        .

        <br>Note: As there are many shades of a color so consider integers as a color name.

      <h3>Question 10: Min & Max?</h3>
      <p>Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly simple array problem to solve. If you
        know how to iterate through the array, you will easily be able to solve this.
        <br> The problem statement is simple- given
        N
        elements, find the minimum and maximum numbers among those elements.
      </p>

      <h3>Input Format</h3>
      <p>First-line contains
        N
        representing the length of the array. <br>
        The second line contains
        N
        space-separated integers.</p>

      <h3>Output Format</h3>
      <p>Return minimum and maximum elements.
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>Sample Input<br>
        6 <br>
        3 1 4 6 2 7<br>

        Sample Output<br>
        1 7 <br> <br>

        Sample Test Case Explanation <br>
        In the first test case<br>
        minimum element =
        1
        and<br>
        maximum element =
        7<br>

        In the second test case<br>
        minimum element =
        0
        and<br>
        maximum element =
        0</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Ans.</h3>
        <pre>
          function arrayMin(arr) {
            let min = arr[0];
            for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
              if(arr[i] < min){
                min = arr[i];
              }
            }
            return min;
        }
          
        function arrayMax(arr) {
           let max = arr[0];
           for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
             if(arr[i] > max){
               max = arr[i];

      <h3>Question 11: Birthday Game</h3>
      <p>Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate
        bar with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by
        A
        [
        i
        ]
        .
        <br>
        She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment
        matches Yatharth's birth month
        M
        and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday
        D
        .
        <br>
        You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
      </p>

      <h3>Input Format</h3>
      <p>1. The first line consists of an integer
        N
        which denotes the number of squares in the chocolate bar. <br>
        2. The second line consists of
        N
        space-separated integers
        A
        [
        i
        ]
        , consisting of numbers on the chocolate bar squares. <br>
        3. The third line contains an integer
        D
        and
        M
        which denotes Yatharth's birthday and his birth month respectively. </p>

      <h3>Output Format</h3>
      <p>Print an integer denoting the total number of ways that Anamika can partition her chocolate bar to share with
        Yatharth.
      </p>
      <h3>Constraints</h3>
      <p>1
        <= N <=90 <br>
          1
          <= A [ i ] <=5 <br>
            1
            <= D <=31 <br>
              1
              <= M <=12</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Sample Input<br>
                  5 <br>
                  2 2 1 3 2<br>
                  4 2 <br>

                  Sample Output<br>
                  2 <br>
                  <br>
                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                Anamika wants to find segments summing to Yatharth's birthday,
                D
                =
                4
                with a length matching his birth month,
                M
                =
                2
                . In this case, two segments are meeting her criteria:
                [
                2
                ,
                2
                ]
                and
                [
                1
                ,
                3
                ]
                .
